This skill uses Twitter public API to get daily parking and transportation updates published 
in @FSUParking twitter account. The twitter account is managed by Florida State University 
Transportation & Parking Services. Simply tell Alexa to ask FSU Parking Updates to get updates 
for today or tomorrow, and stay up to date before leaving for campus!

The skill was accepted and published in Alexa Store. Can be found here: https://www.amazon.com/Shafayat-R-FSU-Parking-Updates/dp/B073GL59BZ

Was done in Summer 2017 within 24 hours. Got an Amazon Echo Dot due to an ongoing promotion about 
Alexa skill publishing. The Echo is okay, but the skill development platform was pretty neat!
